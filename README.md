## Hi there, I'm Sven 👋

## I study computer science and design at Highschool for applied sciences Munich.
- 💻 I'm currently improving on my web-developement skills.
- 🤝 I'm looking forward to learn to build backends and iOS Apps.
- 🏁 My goal for this year is to gather enough knowledge to be able to contribute to Open Source projects.
- 👤 My motivation to become a frontend-engineer and mobile-developer is because i love creating beatufil things just as much as working from home, all over the world.
