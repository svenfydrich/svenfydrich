## Hi there, I'm Sven 👋

## I am a CS student and web developer.
- 💻 I really like Web-Development and at the moment I am improving my React knowledge.
- 🤝 I am currently working at Exaring AG as a Work-Study in Software-Testing (QA) and I am looking forward to become a Junior Frontend-Developer soon.
- 🏁 My goal for this year is to collab on open-source projects (feel free to contact me).
