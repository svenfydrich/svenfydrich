## Hi there, I'm Sven 👋

## I study computer science and design at Highschool for applied sciences Munich.
- 💻 I really like Full-Stack-Development and therefore I am currently improving on my Front-End and Back-End skills.
- 🤝 I am currently working at Exaring AG as a QA-Engineer (Software-Testing) and I am looking forward to become a Full-Stack-Engineer.
- 🏁 My goal for this year is to improve on my current skills as much as possible by developing fun projects.
