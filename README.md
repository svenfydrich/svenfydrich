## Hi there, I'm Sven 👋

## I study computer science and design at Highschool for applied sciences Munich.
- 💻 I really like Web-Development and App-Development and currently I am improving my Swift coding-skills.
- 🤝 I am currently working at Exaring AG as a Work-Study in Software-Testing (QA) and I am looking forward to become a Junior Developer soon.
- 🏁 My goal for this year is to improve on my current skills as much as possible in order to land my first job as junior dev.
